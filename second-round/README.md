# Round 2: Cats with Hats

*“I know it is wet and the sun is not sunny, but we can have lots of good fun that is funny.”*
― Dr. Seuss, The Cat in the Hat

You have a line of 100 cats, numbered from 1 to 100. Every cat is wearing a hat. You walk along the line of cats, stopping at regular intervals. If a cat you stop at has a hat, you take it off. If a cat doesn't have a hat, you give it a hat...
 - On the first iteration, you stop at every single cat.
 - On the second iteration, you stop at every second cat.
 - On the third iteration, you stop at every third cat.
 - And so on, up to the 100th iteration, when you stop at every 100th cat (which will be just one cat!).

Write a method that can work out, after the 100th iteration, what number cats will have hats.

Don't be alarmed, this problem is simply about Arrays. Hint: the first step is to think about what datatype to use to represent a cat with/without a hat.

HAVE FUN!
