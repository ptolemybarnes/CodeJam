## Lazer Kata

Write a method that returns the string it is called upon with a hole blasted in it.

For example:
  $ "makersacademy".lazer(3) #=> "maker___ademy"

As you can see, #lazer takes an argument giving the blast radius. The default blast radius is one, such that:
  $ "tiger".lazer #=> "ti er"

Go forth and arm the lazer!!!k
